# dotfiles

just a combination of configs, icons, and themes leaning into toykonight. Love the theme and color scheme. this mainly just contains some things for me personally to transfer from one distro to another depending on the specs of the computer. I originally uploaded theses while I was using a dell inspiron 13" notebook. Dell has not been kind to me as the cooling solution for the laptop wasnt that great and so it froze and crashed often. 

My laptop situation:
- Dell Inspiron 13 7375 2-in-1
- Asus Zephyrus g14 [2022] * 

Doing my best to link to the origin of all the borrowed assets, my desktop wouldn't have looked like this alone and I'm truly greatful to everyone for posting their own dotfiles that helped culminate in this. As I moved from Fedora to Gentoo, I switched up some of the setups I was using. The most notible being the switch from TokyoNight themeing to Catppuccin (of the mocha varity)

The use of Jetbrains Mono as my prefered font has stayed the same though. I will probably be editing this later as subtrees were not the way I wanted/intended to link to the other repos; its something to look into for me

I would love to point people to some creators I enjoy the work of/borrowed from (there are still some kinks to work out with regards to my setup, but it generally works) 

- [RealStr1ke](https://github.com/RealStr1ke) : I borrowed their dotfiles waybar configs, looking forwared to their future work.
- [Ruixi-rebirth](https://github.com/Ruixi-rebirth) : has a video on youtube showing linux ricing & workflow
