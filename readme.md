# dotfiles

just a combination of configs, icons, and themes leaning into toykonight. Love the theme and color scheme. this mainly just contains some things for me personally to transfer from one distro to another depending on the specs of the computer. It contains:

- icons
- themes
- sway config
- alacrity
- wofi
- waybar

Nothing fancy, some of the configs are borrowed, I'll try to tack them down after a while
