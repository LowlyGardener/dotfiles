# dotfiles

just a combination of configs, icons, and themes leaning into toykonight. Love the theme and color scheme. this mainly just contains some things for me personally to transfer from one distro to another depending on the specs of the computer. I originally uploaded theses while I was using a dell inspiron 13" notebook. Dell has not been kind to me as the cooling solution for the laptop wasnt that great and so it froze and crashed often. 

My laptop situation:
- Dell Inspiron 13 7375 2-in-1
- Asus Zepharus g14 [2022] * 

Doing my best to link to the origin of all the borrowed asseds, my desktop wouldn't have looked like this alone and I'm truly greatful to everyone for posting their own dotfiles that helped culminate in this to this. As I moved from Fedora to Gentoo, I switched up some of the setups I was using. The most notible being the switch from TokyoNight themeing to Catppuccin (of the mocha varity)

The use of Jetbrains Mono as my prefered font has stayed the same though.
